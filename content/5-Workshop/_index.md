# Set up the project called Metropolitano

#### Overview

The Metropolitano AWS Architecture provides a secure, scalable, and highly available cloud environment for running transportation management workloads.
This system leverages multiple AWS services to ensure high performance, strong security controls, fast content delivery, operational monitoring, and continuous deployment.
In this workshop, you will learn how the Metropolitano platform is structured on AWS and how different components integrate to deliver a seamless experience for both end-users and internal operators.

Throughout the lab, you will explore how the system uses core AWS components such as CloudFront, S3, Route 53, EC2, RDS, EventBridge, SQS, SNS, Kinesis, and CodePipeline.
