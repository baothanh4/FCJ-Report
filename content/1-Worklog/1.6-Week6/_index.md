### Week 6 Objectives:
- Understand and practice **AWS Backup**, including creating Backup Vaults, Backup Plans, and deploying backup configurations using **AWS CloudFormation**.  
- Learn how **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)** and **AWS PrivateLink** work, including key components such as ACLs, Rules, Rule Groups, VPC Endpoint Services, and Network Load Balancers.  
- Study **AWS KMS (Key Management Service)** — covering symmetric and asymmetric key management and their role in data encryption.  
- Gain a solid understanding of **Containerization with Docker**, including how to build and deploy applications using **Docker Images** and **Docker Compose**.  
- Strengthen skills in **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and **container-based deployment** for secure and scalable cloud environments.
