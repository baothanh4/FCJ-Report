> Here you can freely provide personal feedback about your experience participating in the **First Cloud Journey** program, helping the FCJ team improve areas that need attention based on the following categories:

### General Evaluation

**1. Work Environment**  
The work environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to support me whenever I face difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, I think additional team bonding or networking sessions could help everyone understand each other more.

**2. Support from Mentors / Team Admins**  
Mentors provide detailed guidance, explain clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourage me to ask questions. The admin team supports administrative tasks, documents, and creates conditions for smooth work. I appreciate that mentors allow me to try and solve problems on my own instead of just giving answers.

**3. Job Fit with Academic Background**  
The tasks assigned match my knowledge from school while also expanding into new areas I had not encountered before. This allowed me to reinforce my foundational knowledge while learning practical skills.

**4. Learning Opportunities & Skill Development**  
During the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork, and professional communication in a corporate environment. Mentors also shared practical experiences, helping me better plan my career path.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive: people respect each other, work seriously but remain cheerful. When urgent projects arise, everyone helps each other regardless of position. This made me feel part of the team even as an intern.

**6. Intern Benefits / Policies**  
The company provides internship allowances and offers flexible working hours when needed. Additionally, participating in internal training sessions is a great advantage.

### Other Questions

- **What are you most satisfied with during the internship?**  
  * During the learning process, I felt comfortable adapting to the company’s work culture and was very satisfied with the guidance from mentors.

- **What do you think the company needs to improve for future interns?**  
  * The company could improve opportunities for students to come to the office daily.

- **If recommending to friends, would you advise them to intern here? Why?**  
  * If I were to introduce this to friends, I would recommend it because **Amazon Web Services Vietnam** is not only a cloud computing company but also has a large **AWS study group community in Vietnam**, allowing students to learn about cloud computing.

### Suggestions & Wishes

- **Any advice to enhance the internship experience?**  
  * I would like to join the company club to learn more from mentors and see how they lead a team.

- **Would you like to continue this program in the future?**
