### 1.3 ASSUMPTIONS

**Prerequisites & Dependencies**
- The Client provides timely access to required environments, systems, and personnel.
- The Client supplies necessary credentials, API documentation, and integration endpoints for on-premises/third-party systems.
- Existing operational data (ticketing, scheduling, payment transactions) is available and accessible for migration and integration.
- Third-party vendors (payment gateways, fare systems, transit card systems) offer stable APIs and complete documentation.
- Required AWS accounts/organizations/billing structures are set up prior to project start.
- The Client identifies Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) for each domain (operations, IT, ticketing, scheduling).

**Technical Constraints**
- Some legacy systems may remain on-premises, requiring hybrid connectivity via VPN or Direct Connect.
- Existing applications may have non-cloud-optimized architectures, limiting modernization within the POC scope.
- Legacy data quality issues may affect migration accuracy and analytics output.
- Operational networks and payment/ticketing systems must support secure and reliable cloud connectivity.
- Real-time analytics performance depends on ingestion latency and stability from payment gateways and ticketing transaction sources.

**Business Constraints**
- Project timelines may depend on internal Client approvals/procurement processes.
- The Client’s organizational readiness and staff availability may impact progress.
- Budget limitations may restrict scope.
- Certain regulatory/compliance requirements may limit data residency/retention options.

**Risks (high-level)**
- Integration risk (legacy undocumented behaviors).
- Data migration risk (inconsistent/incomplete legacy data).
- Operational risk (hybrid/on-prem hardware failures).
- Security risk (misconfigured third-party endpoints).
- Timeline & dependency risk (vendor approvals, API throughput).

## 2. SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE / ARCHITECTURAL DIAGRAM

### 2.1 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM

**Figure 1. AWS Technical Architecture Diagram – Metropolitano Railways (POC)**

<img src="/images/2-Proposal/aws_metropolitano_train_service.png" alt="Figure 1 - Technical Architecture Diagram" />

**Figure 1 (POC Outcome & Architecture Summary):**  
The POC enables near real-time monitoring and reconciliation of ticketing/payment transactions. Payment status events are streamed into **Amazon Kinesis** and delivered to **Amazon S3 (data lake)** for analytics. **Amazon QuickSight** dashboards provide revenue insights (daily/monthly) and highlight unpaid/incomplete payments for follow-up. User traffic is routed via **Route 53 → CloudFront → AWS WAF** to the application on **Amazon EC2**, with transactional data stored in **Amazon RDS (private subnet)**. **Amazon CloudWatch** supports monitoring and alerting. Asynchronous workflows are decoupled using **SNS/SQS** (and **EventBridge** where needed). Source control uses **GitLab**; CI/CD is implemented using **CodePipeline/CodeBuild/CodeDeploy**.

**Production note (recommendations for production readiness):**
- Enable **Multi-AZ** and place workloads in **private subnets** behind an **ALB**.
- Restrict egress using **NAT Gateway** and/or **VPC Endpoints**.
- Enforce **TLS (ACM)**, least-privilege IAM, and store secrets in **Secrets Manager/SSM**.
- Enable **CloudTrail/Config** and strengthen logging (WAF/CloudFront logs).
- Use **blue/green** or **canary** deployments with rollback.

---

### 2.2 TECHNICAL PLAN

**Key activities include:**
- Infrastructure provisioning using IaC templates to deploy:
  - **Amazon EC2** clusters for application workloads
  - **Amazon RDS** for database services
  - **Amazon S3** for static content and data lake storage
  - **Amazon Route 53** for DNS routing
  - **Amazon CloudFront** and **AWS WAF** for secure global content delivery
  - **Amazon Kinesis** for real-time data ingestion
  - **Amazon SQS/SNS** for asynchronous messaging
  - **Amazon EventBridge** for event-driven workflows
  - **Amazon CloudWatch** for logging, monitoring, alarms, and dashboards
  - **Amazon QuickSight** for analytics and BI reporting
- This POC does **not** include AWS Lambda; streaming consumers and asynchronous/background processing are implemented on EC2-based services (or containers) and integrated via SNS/SQS/EventBridge where applicable.
- Application build and release processes will be automated using **CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy**, enabling blue/green or rolling deployments with automated rollback.
- Configuration items requiring approvals (production DNS changes, WAF rule modifications, RDS parameter adjustments, security group updates) will follow the Client’s Change Management Process (including CAB approvals and tracked deployment records).
- Critical paths (ticketing workflows, payment integrations, real-time ingestion, analytics refresh flows) will undergo unit, integration, load, and failover testing. Test scenarios, acceptance criteria, and validation procedures are provided in Appendix X.

**How to calculate man-day (guideline):**
- **Man-day = number of people × number of working days actually spent on the phase.**  
- Example: 5 people work 3 days on “Assessment” → **5 × 3 = 15 man-days**.  
- If you track by hours: **1 man-day ≈ 8 working hours** (common convention).  
  - Example: total 120 hours → **120 / 8 = 15 man-days**.
