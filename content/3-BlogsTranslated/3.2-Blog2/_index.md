# AWS named as a Leader in 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Native Application Platforms and Container Management

A month ago, I shared that [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) is recognized as a [Leader in 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Strategic Cloud Platform Services (SCPS)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-named-as-a-leader-in-2025-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-strategic-cloud-platform-services-for-15-years-in-a-row/), with Gartner naming AWS a Leader for the fifteenth consecutive year.

In 2024, AWS was named as a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for [AI Code Assistants](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-named-as-a-leader-in-the-first-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-ai-code-assistants/), [Cloud-Native Application Platforms](https://pages.awscloud.com/GLOBAL-brand-awareness-content-download-24-gartner-ardm-cloud-application-platforms-mq-learn.html?trk=6ae326d1-79b4-4355-9716-c4ed318beb74&sc_channel=el&wf_id=6729438c0029784a6c773920e5250b88), [Cloud Database Management Systems](https://pages.awscloud.com/GLOBAL-brand-awareness-content-download-24-gartner-ardm-cloud-application-platforms-mq-learn.html?trk=6ae326d1-79b4-4355-9716-c4ed318beb74&sc_channel=el&wf_id=6729438c0029784a6c773920e5250b88), [Container Management](https://pages.awscloud.com/GLOBAL-brand-awareness-content-download-24-gartner-ardm-cloud-application-platforms-mq-learn.html?trk=6ae326d1-79b4-4355-9716-c4ed318beb74&sc_channel=el&wf_id=6729438c0029784a6c773920e5250b88), [Data Integration Tools](https://pages.awscloud.com/GLOBAL-brand-awareness-content-download-24-gartner-ardm-cloud-application-platforms-mq-learn.html?trk=6ae326d1-79b4-4355-9716-c4ed318beb74&sc_channel=el&wf_id=6729438c0029784a6c773920e5250b88), [Desktop as a Service (DaaS)](https://pages.awscloud.com/GLOBAL-brand-awareness-content-download-24-gartner-ardm-cloud-application-platforms-mq-learn.html?trk=6ae326d1-79b4-4355-9716-c4ed318beb74&sc_channel=el&wf_id=6729438c0029784a6c773920e5250b88), and [Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/aws-recognized-as-a-first-time-leader-in-the-2024-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-platforms/) as well as the SCPS. In 2025, we were also recognized as a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for [Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/contact-center/aws-recognized-as-a-leader-in-the-2025-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-contact-center-as-a-service-ccaas-with-amazon-connect/), [Desktop as a Service](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/desktop-and-application-streaming/aws-recognized-as-a-leader-in-2025-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-desktop-as-a-service/) and [Data Science and Machine Learning (DSML)](https://pages.awscloud.com/GLOBAL-brand-awareness-content-download-25-gartner-ardm-magic-quadrant-for-desktop-as-a-service-mq-learn.html?trk=8a887164-7100-4226-b322-ec08c02bbdaf&sc_channel=el) platforms. We strongly believe this means AWS provides the broadest and deepest range of services to customers.

Today, I’m happy to share recent Magic Quadrant reports that named AWS as a Leader in more cloud technology markets: Cloud-Native Application Platforms (aka Cloud Application Platforms) and Container Management.

## 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Native Application Platforms

AWS has been named a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Native Application Platforms for 2 consecutive years. AWS was positioned highest on “Ability to Execute”. Gartner defines cloud-native application platforms as those that provide managed application runtime environments for applications and integrated capabilities to manage the lifecycle of an application or application component in the cloud environment.
The following image is the graphical representation of the 2025 Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Native Application Platforms.



![Figure 1: Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Native Application Flatforms](/images/2025_Gartner_MQ_for_Cloud_Native.png)

Our comprehensive cloud-native application portfolio—[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [AWS App Runner](https://aws.amazon.com/apprunner/), [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/), and [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/)—offers flexible options for building modern applications with strong AI capabilities, demonstrated through continued innovation and deep integration across our broader AWS service portfolio.

You can simplify the service selection through comprehensive documentation, reference architectures, and prescriptive guidance available in the [AWS Solutions Library](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/), along with AI-powered, contextual recommendations from [Amazon Q](https://aws.amazon.com/q/) based on your specific requirements. While AWS Lambda is optimized for AWS to provide the best possible serverless experience, it follows industry standards for serverless computing and supports common programming languages and frameworks. You can find all necessary capabilities within AWS, including advanced features for AI/ML, edge computing, and enterprise integration.

You can build, deploy, and scale [generative AI](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/) agents and applications by integrating these compute offerings with [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) for serverless inferences and [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) for [artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)](https://aws.amazon.com/training/learn-about/ai/) training and management.

## 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Container Management



In the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Container Management, AWS has been named as a Leader for three years and was positioned furthest for “Completeness of Vision”. Gartner defines container management as offerings that support the deployment and operation of containerized workloads. This process involves orchestrating and overseeing the entire lifecycle of containers, covering deployment, scaling, and operations, to ensure their efficient and consistent performance across different environments.

The following image is the graphical representation of the 2025 Magic Quadrant for Container Management.

[AWS container services](https://aws.amazon.com/containers/) offer fully managed container orchestration with AWS native solutions and open-source technologies to focus on providing a wide range of deployment options, from Kubernetes to our native orchestrator.

You can use [Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) and [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/). Both can be used with [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) for serverless container deployment. Additionally, EKS Auto Mode simplifies Kubernetes management by automatically provisioning infrastructure, selecting optimal compute instances, and dynamically scaling resources for containerized applications.

You can connect on-premises and edge infrastructure back to AWS container services with [EKS Hybrid Nodes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/hybrid-nodes-overview.html) and [ECS Anywhere](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/anywhere/), or use [EKS Anywhere](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-anywhere/) for a fully disconnected Kubernetes experience supported by AWS. With flexible compute and deployment options, you can reduce operational overhead and focus on innovation and drive business value faster.

<!-- ## Front Door Microservice

- Provides an API Gateway for external REST interaction  
- Authentication & authorization based on **OIDC** via **Amazon Cognito**  
- Self-managed *deduplication* mechanism using DynamoDB instead of SNS FIFO because:  
  1. SNS deduplication TTL is only 5 minutes  
  2. SNS FIFO requires SQS FIFO  
  3. Ability to proactively notify the sender that the message is a duplicate  

---

## Staging ER7 Microservice

- Lambda “trigger” subscribed to the pub/sub hub, filtering messages by attribute  
- Step Functions Express Workflow to convert ER7 → JSON  
- Two Lambdas:  
  1. Fix ER7 formatting (newline, carriage return)  
  2. Parsing logic  
- Result or error is pushed back into the pub/sub hub  

---

## New Features in the Solution

### 1. AWS CloudFormation Cross-Stack References
Example *outputs* in the core microservice:
```yaml
Outputs:
  Bucket:
    Value: !Ref Bucket
    Export:
      Name: !Sub ${AWS::StackName}-Bucket
  ArtifactBucket:
    Value: !Ref ArtifactBucket
    Export:
      Name: !Sub ${AWS::StackName}-ArtifactBucket
  Topic:
    Value: !Ref Topic
    Export:
      Name: !Sub ${AWS::StackName}-Topic
  Catalog:
    Value: !Ref Catalog
    Export:
      Name: !Sub ${AWS::StackName}-Catalog
  CatalogArn:
    Value: !GetAtt Catalog.Arn
    Export:
      Name: !Sub ${AWS::StackName}-CatalogArn -->
