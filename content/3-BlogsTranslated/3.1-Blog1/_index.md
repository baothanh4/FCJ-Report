# AWS services scale to new heights for Prime Day 2025: key metrics and milestones

[Amazon Prime Day 2025](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/prime-day-2025-recap) was the biggest Amazon Prime Day shopping event ever, setting records for both sales volume and total items sold during the 4-day event. Prime members saved billions while shopping Amazon’s millions of deals during the event.

This year marked a significant transformation in the Prime Day experience through advancements in the [generative AI offerings from Amazon and AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/). Customers used [Alexa+](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-generative-artificial-intelligence)—the Amazon next-generation personal assistant now available in early access to millions of customers—along with the AI-powered shopping assistant, [Rufus](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-rufus-online-shopping-tips), and [AI Shopping Guides](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-ai-shopping-guides-product-research-recommendations). These features, built on more than 15 years of cloud innovation and machine learning expertise from AWS, combined with deep retail and consumer experience from Amazon, helped customers quickly discover deals and get product information, complementing the fast, free delivery that Prime members enjoy year-round.

As part of our annual tradition to tell you about how AWS powered Prime Day for record-breaking sales, I want to share the services and chart-topping metrics from AWS that made your amazing shopping experience possible.

## Prime Day 2025 – all the numbers

During the weeks leading up to big shopping events like Prime Day, Amazon fulfillment centers and delivery stations work to get ready and ensure operations run efficiently and safely. For example, the [Amazon automated storage and retrieval system (ASRS)](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/amazon-million-robots-ai-foundation-model) operates a global fleet of industrial mobile robots that move goods around Amazon fulfillment centers.

[AWS Outposts](https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/), a fully managed service that extends the AWS experience on-premises, powers software applications that manage the command-and-control of Amazon ASRS and supports same-day and next-day deliveries through low-latency processing of critical robotic commands.

During Prime Day 2025, AWS Outposts at one of the largest Amazon fulfillment centers sent more than 524 million commands to over 7,000 robots, reaching peak volumes of 8 million commands per hour—a 160 percent increase compared to Prime Day 2024.

Amazon also deployed over 87,000 [AWS Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/inferentia/) and [AWS Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/trainium/) chips – custom silicon chips for deep learning and generative AI training and inference – to power [Amazon Rufus](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-rufus) for Prime Day.
