During my internship at **Amazon Web Services Vietnam Company** from **09/2025** to **12/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.  
I participated in **Learning how to use all services and how they work on AWS**, through which I improved my skills in **practicing workshop, apply the AWS services in my application**. Also i have to optimize the cost, performance and increased security layers 

When i am in the company, i always to check my to do list and check all the task that i haven't done yesterday.

### Needs Improvement

* I am internal person so i barely communicated with my mentor, i need to change my how to communicate with my mentor and spend time to meet them to ask them about my problem.
* I need improve my project management skill because i have to train my teammates and give them a task but i don't have a method like Agile or Scrum to develop a software like coworker.
* I always to think about how the services work and how they apply to my application but sometime i don't understand them, so i need to spend time to improve my logic mindset to understand them.
